# Binary operations on images
The app implements binary operations (AND, OR, XOR) on two images ([reference](https://hcimage.com/help/Content/Quantitation/Measurements/Processing%20and%20Analysis/Modify/Copy%20of%20Binary_Operations.htm)). The input images should have the same format (one of these: '.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.bmp'), the ouput will be in '.bmp' format.
